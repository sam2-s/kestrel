# Starling threat model

Written before the code, kept honest after it. Claims here are backed by tests
where a test can back them (see `test/`), and marked as limits where it
cannot. This is protocol v2: forward secrecy, post-compromise security, and
cryptographic member removal, and as of 0.5.0 it is wired end to end, crypto
core through relay through storage through UI, on web and on Android. Read
[docs/AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) for the file:line map of where each property lives
and for the questions we most want an independent auditor to attack first.
Nobody has done that audit yet; see "No human security audit" below.

## What changed from v1

- **Forward secrecy**, bounded by the history window. Content keys advance
  once per 10-minute epoch and the previous key is destroyed on the device
  that advanced past it. A device can only ever be made to give up the trail
  still inside its retained window (10 minutes to 24 hours, a user setting),
  never anything older.
- **Post-compromise security.** A re-key mixes fresh ECDH entropy into a new
  generation with its own chain and its own channel. Holding today's keys
  says nothing about tomorrow's, once someone re-keys.
- **Member removal is now cryptographic**, not advisory. Removing someone is
  a re-key that excludes them: they receive no wrap, derive no new seed, and
  cannot follow the circle to its next channel. A v1 removal only asked
  everyone else to rotate; it did not, by itself, stop the removed device
  from reading anything it already held.
- **Invites are one-time credentials**, not bearer tokens. A v1 invite link
  carried the circle secret itself, so anyone who ever saw the link held
  every past and future key it protected. A v2 invite bootstraps a pairwise
  handshake; the circle's actual key material is handed over only after a
  human accepts the joiner's safety number, and the invite is burned the
  moment that happens. The link also carries a 128-bit commitment to the
  inviter's keypair, and the joiner refuses a welcome from anybody else. That
  is what makes the direction nobody thinks about safe: without it, whoever
  else saw the link could answer it first, seal a circle of their own to the
  joiner, and own the joining device while the app said "You joined".
- **Beacon links are per-viewer and revocable, with an expiry that is
  actually enforced.** Each person you send help to gets their own secret and
  their own derived channel; revoking one stops posting to that channel and
  sends it a final `bye` without touching the others. Past its expiry the
  viewer page stops polling on its own, and the beacon stops posting to that
  viewer's channel, on both ends, independent of each other.

## What the relay can never learn

The relay (and anyone who compromises it, subpoenas it, or dumps its
database) gets ciphertext and metadata only:

- No positions. Locations are AES-256-GCM encrypted on the device with a key
  that never leaves member devices, per-epoch and per-sender so no two
  members and no two epochs ever share a key.
- No names, avatars, or circle names. All identity travels inside ciphertext.
  Member slots are ids derived from two public keys (signing and agreement),
  not from anything a relay chose or assigned.
- No accounts, phone numbers, emails, or push tokens. There is nothing to
  link a channel to a person except traffic metadata.
- No history beyond the TTL. Rows expire at 24 h and there are no backups by
  design. A full seizure of the relay yields at most one day of ciphertext,
  and less than that for any epoch a device has already advanced past.

## What the relay does learn, honestly

- **IP addresses and timing.** Each poll and post reveals a source IP and a
  cadence. On top of an always-on VPN or Tor this drops to the exit's IP.
  There is no cover traffic between members, no mixnet, no private
  information retrieval. A "steady cadence" setting exists and posts on a
  fixed interval whether or not a member has moved, which hides *when* a
  member moves; it is a real, smaller property, not a substitute for cover
  traffic, and it does nothing about the fact that the relay still sees a
  post arrive on that cadence from that IP.
- **How many members post to a channel.** Channel shape (member slot count,
  update rhythm) is visible; ciphertext sizes carry nothing, because every
  message type pads to the same fixed length regardless of what it is.
- **A correlation signal between an SOS and its circle.** Firing an SOS opens
  a second channel, on its own key material, from the same device, at the
  same instant, as the circle's own channel. The keys are unlinkable by
  construction; the timing is not. A relay operator watching arrival times
  does not need to break any cryptography to notice that two channels tend to
  update together from one IP address. This is a real gap, not a theoretical
  one, and nothing in the design closes it.
- **That you use Starling at all** (from the origin you talk to).

## Who the relay operator is

The default relay, at starlingmap.app, runs on Cloudflare Workers with a
Cloudflare D1 database. Cloudflare terminates TLS for it, so Cloudflare is
the party seeing everything the section above describes: source IPs, channel
ids, timing, and request sizes, for every poll and every post that goes
through the default relay. When this document or the adversaries table below
says "relay operator," that is who it means, for anyone who has not opted
into a self-hosted relay. Self-hosting does not need Cloudflare either: the
relay also runs as a plain Node server behind your own reverse proxy
(`docs/SELF-HOSTING.md`), in which case your server, and whoever you trust
with access to it, is the relay operator this section is about instead.

What Cloudflare does not get is the plaintext. Positions, names, and circle
membership are encrypted on the device before anything is sent, under keys
that ride only in an invite link's fragment and are never transmitted to any
relay in any form. A subpoena to Cloudflare gets ciphertext and metadata, the
same thing a full database seizure gets, described above; it does not get a
position or an identity, because there is no key on that side to produce
them with.

A subpoena or a court order aimed at the relay is served on Cloudflare, and
Cloudflare can be compelled to comply without our knowledge or cooperation.
That is worth being explicit about for anyone deciding whether the default
relay is an acceptable trust boundary: the answer does not depend on trusting
us, since we would have nothing to comply with even if asked, but it does
depend on trusting Cloudflare's infrastructure to keep working the way this
document describes it. Anyone who wants that boundary to be someone other
than Cloudflare can run their own relay; see the FAQ and
[docs/PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for how.

## Adversaries considered

| adversary | result |
|---|---|
| Relay operator, or attacker with full DB read | ciphertext plus the metadata above; no positions, no identities, and no epoch older than what a device's retained history window still holds |
| Attacker who scrapes a `channel_id` (128-bit, unguessable; would require relay compromise) | can fetch ciphertext they cannot decrypt without a device's retained keys; can write junk rows that fail GCM authentication on every member's device and render as nothing; cannot overwrite real members (writes are signature-checked against pinned keys) |
| Network attacker replaying captured requests | blocked by the strictly-increasing `(epoch, ts)` rule receivers enforce themselves, independent of the relay; cross-channel and cross-member replay blocked by AAD binding, which now also binds the epoch |
| Malicious circle member | already trusted with your location while you share; can spam or lie about their own position, and can trigger a re-key to remove other members (any member may re-key by design, see `docs/PROTOCOL.md`, "Re-keying"). Cannot speak as another member: receivers verify each sender's signature against that member's pinned key. Remedy for a member you no longer trust is removal via re-key, which is cryptographically complete, not a request they can ignore |
| Malicious member colluding with the relay | still cannot forge another member's position, and still cannot un-remove itself after the rest of the circle re-keys without it, because the next generation's seed is mixed from ECDH entropy delivered only to retained members |
| A stranger who claims a member seat by posting to the circle channel first | refused: a `member` record is only ever honoured on an invite channel, sealed to a verified inviter's welcome context, never on a circle channel (`app/js/membership.js`, `circleControl`). A circle channel carries exactly one control type, `rekey`, and a re-key is only ever accepted from a sender already pinned before that ingest pass began (`app/js/net.js`, `wasPinned`), so a first-seen sender cannot pin itself and be obeyed in the same breath |
| Malicious server operator shipping poisoned app JS | fatal, as for every web app including web clients of E2EE messengers. Mitigations: no third party scripts, strict CSP, subresource-free single origin, service worker pins the app shell. Real fix is a store-distributed native wrapper; the Android app already ships that way, though not yet through an app store, see "Distribution, honestly" below |
| Stolen unlocked phone, app lock OFF | attacker sees what the app shows and holds the circle's current keys. Panic wipe clears local state; rotating the circle from another device cuts the stolen device off at the next re-key, and everything older than the stolen device's own retained window was already gone before it was stolen |
| Stolen unlocked phone, app lock ON | the circle secret is AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest under a random vault key, itself wrapped by an Argon2id (64 MiB, three passes) key from the passcode and, optionally, a WebAuthn PRF secret or (Android) a Keystore key gated behind biometrics. A locked app holds no plaintext secret, vault key, or channel id in memory or on disk. `test/e2e_lock.py` asserts the plaintext secret is deleted the moment lock turns on and that a reload comes back with no derivable channel |
| A device that missed more than 30 days of a generation's traffic | cannot advance that generation's ratchet further on its own (`MAX_CATCHUP_EPOCHS` refuses the jump); recovery is a fresh invite, the same path as a new member, not a silent failure that looks like a working app |
| Malicious server operator shipping poisoned app JS on Android | does not apply the same way: the Android app's assets ship inside the signed APK, not fetched from the server on every load |
| Malicious server operator targeting one visitor to `/help` (the beacon viewer, the one page the hosted site still serves for security-relevant work) | not stopped, only made checkable: `script-src 'self'`, no third party code, and published per-release asset hashes (`tools/asset-hashes.mjs`) turn a targeted swap into a detectable event for anyone who diffs the live page against the manifest, not a prevented one. See [docs/WEB-INTEGRITY.md](WEB-INTEGRITY.md) for why this is the honest ceiling and why circles never go through the browser at all |

## Design consequences (privacy first, opposite defaults to Life360)

- Sharing is **off** until you turn it on, and the UI always shows a live
  sharing indicator while it is on.
- Coarse mode degrades your position on your device before encryption, so
  even circle members only get neighborhood accuracy when that is what you
  chose.
- Stopping sharing is one tap and posts an authenticated `bye` so others see
  "stopped" instead of a silently stale dot.
- Map tiles come from a tile server when a basemap is on; that reveals your
  viewport to the tile host. The privacy basemap ("Off-grid") renders locally
  and makes zero tile requests. The settings screen explains this trade.
- No analytics, no telemetry, no crash reporting, no third party requests of
  any kind from the app origin.
- Optional app lock encrypts the circle secret at rest. It is off by default
  (like Signal's screen lock), turns on with a passcode, and can add
  biometric unlock where the platform supports it. Auto-lock relocks after a
  chosen idle delay in the background, and every launch starts locked.
- Places (named spots with arrival and leave alerts) are computed on-device
  against positions that already arrive as part of sharing. Nothing about a
  place, not its name, not its coordinates, not even that one exists, is
  ever sent to the relay or to other members. With the app lock on, the
  place list is sealed at rest under the same vault key as the circle
  secret, and a plaintext copy left behind by an interrupted lock
  transition is adopted and resealed at the next unlock rather than left
  readable.
- A place can carry a privacy fence. While your precise position falls
  inside a fenced place, the position that gets sealed and sent is the
  place's center, not the fix, and the accuracy field is withheld; your
  circle sees that you are there, never where within. The snap happens
  before encryption on your own device, the message is padded to the same
  fixed size as every other, and the relay sees the same opaque post either
  way, so neither the relay nor a member's client can tell a fence exists.
  Two honest edges: an SOS always sends your real position, because someone
  coming to help needs it, and fences apply to precise mode only, since the
  neighborhood grid is already coarser than any fence. Circle members DO
  receive the fence center while you are inside, which is exactly the
  point: treat a fenced place's center as shared the way any position is.
- An optional duress passcode runs the full panic wipe from the lock screen
  and comes back up as a fresh install. It can never equal the unlock
  passcode, in either direction of change.

## Known limits, stated plainly

1. **No human security audit, and that gap is not theoretical.** The
   constructions are deliberately boring (AES-GCM, HKDF-SHA-256,
   Ed25519/P-256, all through WebCrypto), the design is written down before
   the code, and 500-plus unit tests replay committed test vectors an independent
   implementation could check itself against. None of that is a substitute
   for an independent reviewer. What verification exists: negative controls
   run against the load-bearing security tests (deliberately breaking the
   implementation and confirming the matching test fails, so a passing suite
   is evidence the check is wired to something real, not just present),
   headless-browser end to end suites driving real Firefox through create,
   invite, a byte-for-byte safety number comparison, accept, re-key,
   cross-visibility, check-in, SOS, the help viewer, revocation, and app
   lock, two rounds of multi-agent adversarial review with independent
   refutation, and a cross-model audit using a different model family than
   the one that wrote the code. The second adversarial round found about
   thirty real defects in code the first round had already passed over and
   marked reviewed; the cross-model audit found two more real bugs after
   that. That trajectory is itself the evidence: more review kept finding
   real bugs, not diminishing returns, and there is no reason to believe the
   pattern stopped because the reviewing stopped. Weigh every other claim in
   this document accordingly, and see [docs/AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) for exactly
   where to start looking.
2. **Forward secrecy is bounded by the history window, not absolute.** A
   device that has advanced past an epoch has destroyed that epoch's key;
   anything still inside its retained window (10 minutes to 24 hours,
   depending on the user's setting) is still on the device, in memory or on
   disk, because that is the trail the user chose to be able to read. A
   device compromise that catches the key before it is destroyed exposes
   only what remains in that window, never the full circle history.
3. **Post-compromise security requires an actual re-key.** Holding a
   compromised device's current keys is not automatically remediated; someone
   has to trigger a re-key (removing the compromised device, or a manual "new
   keys now") for the circle to heal. Nothing detects a compromise on its
   own.
4. **The relay still learns metadata.** IP addresses, timing, and how many
   members post to a channel. There is no cover traffic and no mixnet. On top
   of a VPN or Tor this drops to the exit's IP; the timing and the count
   remain regardless. The steady-cadence setting hides only *when* a member
   moves, not that the relay sees traffic from them at all.
5. **An SOS is a correlation signal, even though its keys are unlinkable.** A
   circle channel and a beacon channel from the same device update at the
   same time from the same IP. A relay operator watching traffic does not
   need to break anything to notice that.
6. **Bus factor is one, and there are close to zero real users.** This is one
   person's design and one person's code review. There is no team, no second
   reviewer, no institution behind it, and no track record yet of running
   under real adversarial conditions.
7. **A browser cannot zeroise memory or guarantee a storage overwrite erases
   anything.** Deleted keys are `.fill(0)`'d and dropped, but JavaScript
   garbage collects rather than zeroises, and IndexedDB writes go through a
   database engine and, usually, a flash translation layer that may leave old
   bytes physically present until the underlying block is reused. Forward
   secrecy is a claim about what the application retains and requests to
   read, not a claim about what is physically recoverable from a seized
   device. See `docs/PROTOCOL.md`, "History window and destruction," and
   `docs/AUDIT.md`, "Deletion schedule, honestly," for the specifics.
8. **Anyone in a circle sees everyone in it.** There is no sub-grouping and
   no per-member visibility control. A member who is compromised compromises
   the circle's present; the design's answer is fast, complete removal via
   re-key, not preventing that member from having seen anything up to the
   point they are removed.
9. **No post-quantum protection.** P-256 and Ed25519 throughout. A
   harvest-now-decrypt-later adversary who records today's ciphertext and
   waits for a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is in scope for
   this threat model and not addressed by the cryptography here. It is
   bounded only by the relay's 24-hour retention: nothing recorded off the
   wire can be decrypted later even with unlimited future compute, because
   the relay itself does not keep it past a day, and a device's own retained
   window is shorter than that for most settings.
10. **A circle invite still needs a human to say yes.** v2 removes the
    bearer-token weakness of a v1 invite, but the cost is real: the inviter
    has to come back online and accept the joiner's safety number before the
    joiner gets any key material. A stolen link is inert until then, and
    inert afterward too unless a human accepts a safety number they were not
    expecting. Whoever holds a stolen link also cannot answer it: the
    commitment in the fragment names the inviter's keys, so forging a welcome
    means a second preimage on 128 bits rather than being quick.
11. **Web platform ceiling.** Background sharing ends when the OS suspends
    the tab. Starling is honest about being live-when-open (plus a wake lock
    toggle) on the web, rather than pretending to be an always-on tracker;
    the Android app's foreground service is what actually solves this, at
    the cost of a persistent notification.
12. **App-lock passcode strength is the user's.** The at-rest encryption is
    only as strong as the passcode behind it; Argon2id makes each guess cost
    64 MiB and three passes, which takes the GPU shortcut away, but a
    four-digit PIN is still ten thousand guesses. The Argon2id runs inside a
    WebAssembly module with no imports, built from the reference
    implementation and hash-pinned by the loader ([ARGON2.md](ARGON2.md)). There is no
    passcode recovery by design: a forgotten passcode means erasing the
    device and rejoining from an invite, because the secret is genuinely
    unrecoverable without it.
13. **The iOS app is a bundled wrapper, not the web page, and the web page
    still does not open circles.** The old form of this limit said there was
    no iOS app at all, because a browser tab cannot hold a long-lived circle
    secret: every integrity mechanism Safari ships (Subresource Integrity,
    the new Integrity-Policy header) checks served bytes against a reference
    the origin itself supplies, so none of them help against a hostile or
    coerced origin, and the extensions that make a targeted swap detectable
    elsewhere do not exist on iOS. All of that still holds, and the hosted
    site still refuses circles on every platform: see "The hosted web page
    does not open circles" below and [WEB-INTEGRITY.md](WEB-INTEGRITY.md).
    What changed is that `ios/` now ships what that argument actually calls
    for: a wrapper whose page comes out of a signed app bundle, never off
    the network, and holds a real circle. Its deltas against the Android app
    are enumerated in "The iOS app's deltas" below; the largest is that
    background sharing does not exist, because iOS has no equivalent of the
    Android foreground service.
14. **F-Droid ships the developer's APK, and trails a release.** Starling
    has been on F-Droid since 2026-09-23 as a reproducible build: F-Droid
    builds the tagged source itself, checks that the result matches the
    APK published on GitHub, and then distributes that developer-signed
    APK rather than one signed with its own key. That makes F-Droid an
    independent check that the published APK comes from the published
    source, and it means one signature across F-Droid, GitHub and
    starlingmap.app. What it does not mean is that F-Droid has every
    release the day it ships: its build cycle can trail a tag by days, and
    a release it has not built yet is only on GitHub and the site.
15. **A duress passcode's existence is visible in storage.** The unlock
    passcode's verifier is the GCM tag of a wrapped key, so it stores
    nothing that says "a passcode exists" beyond the lock itself. A duress
    code unlocks nothing, so its verifier is an Argon2id hash sitting in the
    clear (PBKDF2 for a duress code set before 0.16, until it is set again), and anyone who reads the device's storage before the wipe can
    see that a duress code is configured, though not what it is. What the
    feature actually defends against is someone watching you type: the two
    codes are indistinguishable at the keyboard, and by the time storage
    can be read calmly, the wipe has either run or was never needed. If
    your threat includes a forensic read BEFORE coercion, do not set one.
16. **Event notifications go through the OS, and arrive only while the app
    can listen.** On Android, an SOS, arrival, or low-battery alert posted
    while the app is hidden is a system notification. Its title and text
    never carry a member's name or a place name: those stay inside the app,
    and the OS-level notification always reads the same generic line, on
    every Android version and regardless of the device's own lock-screen
    content setting. That last part matters because the setting does not
    default the way you would guess: a `VISIBILITY_PRIVATE` notification's
    real content is shown on the lock screen by default on stock Android
    (`Settings.Secure.LOCK_SCREEN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NOTIFICATIONS` ships `true`),
    so a design that put a name or place in the notification and relied on
    `VISIBILITY_PRIVATE` to keep it off a locked screen would not have,
    unless the phone's owner had separately turned on "hide sensitive
    notification content." Nothing is sent to any push service, there are no
    push tokens, and the notification is built locally. With no push service
    there is nothing that can wake a phone Starling is not running on: the
    app polls in the background (the location-sharing service keeps it alive
    while you share), so alerts reach a pocketed phone while sharing is on,
    but a phone with the app swiped away, frozen by the OS, or powered off
    sees the alert on the next open. Life360-grade "the push wakes the phone
    no matter what" is exactly the tradeoff Starling refuses, because the
    token that buys it is an address a server holds for you. An SOS is the
    one alert that is loud on purpose: it goes out on its own "Emergency
    alerts" channel as an alarm (alarm audio usage and the alarm category),
    so Do Not Disturb lets it through wherever alarms are allowed, which is
    Android's default, and it plays at the alarm volume. Its text is the
    same generic line as every other alert. Settings, Places and alerts
    opens that channel's system page for anyone who wants it through total
    silence as well.
17. **The sharing notification itself is a leak Android requires.** While
    you share, Android requires a visible foreground notification ("Sharing
    with your circle") for as long as the location service runs; there is no
    code path that removes this and still keeps sharing working. Android 14
    and later let a person swipe it away on an unlocked phone while the
    service keeps running, so Starling puts it straight back for as long as
    the share runs: hiding that a phone is sharing takes ending the share.
    If you find a way to hide it while the share goes on, please report it
    the way SECURITY.md asks.
    Anyone holding the phone, locked or not, learns from it alone that
    Starling is installed and is transmitting your position right now.
    That notification also carries a Stop button. On Android 12 and up,
    tapping it from a locked screen requires the device to be unlocked
    first (`Notification.Action.Builder.setAuthenticationRequired`); on
    Android 11 and below there is no such gate, and Stop fires straight from
    the lock screen. Either way, since this fix, ending a share by tapping
    Stop posts the same "Sharing stopped" notification that swiping the app
    away already posted, so a share someone else ended from a locked phone
    is not silently indistinguishable from one still running.
18. **Localization is young.** The app has a translation layer (gettext
    style: English source strings as keys, catalogs shipped with the app,
    nothing fetched) and ships Spanish, German, French and Brazilian
    Portuguese, selectable in settings or following the system language.
    Honest caveats: Spanish was reviewed line by line by a native speaker
    (issue #1); German, French and Portuguese are first passes by the
    developer and have not had that review yet, and mistranslated security
    guidance is worse than English, so rough edges deserve bug reports; the
    website and long-form docs are still English; and no RTL language ships
    yet, though the engine and document wiring are RTL-ready.
    `tools/extract-strings.mjs` regenerates the full catalog for anyone who
    wants to add a language, and a test refuses any new UI string that any
    shipped catalog does not cover.

## Emergency beacon

An SOS mints a beacon: a separate share, on its own channel, under its own
secret and its own fresh signing identity, for people outside the circle. The
link opens in any browser with no app and no account.

What it is good for: the neighbour, the colleague, the friend three blocks
away who is not in your circle and will not install anything in the next two
minutes.

Its properties, as wired:

- A help link is a **bearer capability for one emergency, scoped to one
  viewer**. Whoever holds it watches that session's positions and nothing
  else in the system: not the circle, not its other members, not any
  history, and not any other viewer's link.
- Each viewer gets an **independent secret and derived channel**. The relay
  cannot link two viewers' channels to each other or to the circle by key
  material. Revoking one viewer ends only that channel, with a final `bye`
  so the helper sees "session ended" rather than a frozen dot; the others
  keep receiving positions.
- **Expiry is enforced at both ends.** Past a viewer's `expiresAt`, the
  viewer page stops polling and says the link is over, and the beacon stops
  posting to that viewer's channel independently, so a link that says it is
  dead has nothing left on the relay to read even if the viewer page were
  bypassed.
- The beacon is **memory-only** and ends on check-in, stop-sharing, app lock,
  or process death, sending `bye` to every still-live viewer. A new SOS mints
  new secrets for every viewer, so an old link stays dead.
- The relay learns that some number of beacon channels exist and their
  posting cadence. It cannot link any of them to a circle by key material or
  member id, though a relay watching traffic timing can see a beacon channel
  and a circle channel updating together from one address at the same
  instant, as described above.
- Anyone the link reaches can **forward it**. That is inherent to a link that
  works with no account, and it is the trade being made: reachability in an
  emergency, in exchange for not controlling who ends up watching a link
  once it is sent. Revocation stops a specific viewer's *channel*; it does
  not un-send a link that person already forwarded again before you revoked.
- The viewer page **loads street tiles immediately**. It is an emergency
  page for someone with no app, so it opens on a real map with no off-grid
  option, which means every helper's browser fetches
  `tile.openstreetmap.org` tiles of the shared position's area: the tile
  host sees each helper's IP and the emergency's street-level viewport, on
  top of the relay metadata above. A helper who cannot accept that should
  not open the link from a network they need to protect.

## Check-in timer

A check-in timer is a deadline you set for yourself: check in within the hour,
or your circle hears about it. While it runs, every post from your phone carries
the deadline inside the sealed plaintext, and it is your circle's phones that
notice when it passes. The alert does not depend on your phone being on, which
is the point: a phone that was taken, smashed or switched off cannot report
itself missing.

- The relay learns nothing new. The deadline rides inside the same padded
  ciphertext as everything else, and setting a timer is one more post of the
  usual size, which looks like any other check-in or position.
- Phones on older versions ignore the field, so anyone in your circle still
  running one is not told when you miss a check-in.
- A receiver hears about a missed check-in only while its own app can listen,
  the limit in item 16 above. If every phone in your circle is off or has the
  app swiped away, the alert waits for the next one to open the app.
- Only a check-in tapped on your phone stops it. Stopping sharing, the app
  lock, leaving the circle, Panic and the duress passcode all leave the deadline
  where it is on the other phones, on purpose: someone made to stop sharing or
  wipe the app is exactly who the timer is for. The cost is that a wipe you
  chose still ends in an alert at the deadline unless you check in first.
- The deadline is kept on your phone in plaintext next to the circle identity,
  like the record that a share was running, so a seized phone shows that a
  timer is set and when it runs out, even with the app locked.

## Multiple circles

Since 0.3.0 a device can hold several circles, one active at a time. As of
0.5.0 the storage layer (`app/js/circles.js`) holds each circle as a v2
generation, not a flat secret: a `genMeta` record naming the generation
(`g`, `e0`, the epoch the retained chain key belongs to, the channel id), the
retained chain key itself (still called `secret` in the storage layer, for
continuity with every crash-window rule already proven around that slot, but
now the oldest chain key the ratchet still holds rather than a permanent
root), and the pinned member roster with both keys per member.

Each circle has its own generation, its own channel, and its own signing
identity, created fresh on join; the relay sees no link between the channels
a device belongs to. Polling and sharing happen only for the active circle.
At rest, inactive circles' names, generation metadata, pinned rosters,
profiles, and timestamps live in one sealed blob under the same vault key as
the active circle's state when the app lock is on; their signing and
agreement keypairs are non-extractable CryptoKeys stored beside it, which
means a locked device still reveals how many identities it holds but no
names, keys, or channel ids. Mid-switch crash safety is duplicate-not-lose:
the array grows to hold both circles before the active slots change hands and
shrinks only afterwards, and boot and unlock reconciliation drop whatever
duplicate a crash strands.

## The hosted web page does not open circles

The page at starlingmap.app is a landing plus the demo. It hides the create
and join paths, never decrypts a stored circle, and points invite links at
the apps - the Android APK, or on iOS the build-from-source wrapper, whose
paste-join flow is the hand-off until universal links exist. Rationale: the web delivery channel is the weakest link in this
design, and the browser offers no OS-keystore-backed storage for a long-lived
circle secret. Removing circles from the hosted surface removes its value as
a target. The full app still runs on localhost for development, and the test
suites exercise it there.

The one page the hosted site does serve for security-relevant work is
`/help`, the beacon viewer, because a beacon secret is short-lived and scoped
to one emergency rather than long-lived and scoped to a whole circle's
history. [docs/WEB-INTEGRITY.md](WEB-INTEGRITY.md) states exactly what a
strict CSP and published asset hashes buy for that page (a targeted swap
becomes detectable) and what they do not (prevented, or automatically
caught): the honest state of the art here is a deterrent, not a guarantee,
and that is why circles stay off the web entirely rather than getting the
same trade.

## Distribution, honestly

- **GitHub release and the direct APK at starlingmap.app.** Both work today
  and are signed with the same key (`AllowedAPKSigningKeys` in
  `docs/fdroid/app.starlingmap.yml`).
- **F-Droid.** Live since 2026-09-23 at
  <https://f-droid.org/packages/app.starlingmap/>, shipping the same
  developer-signed APK after a reproducible-build check; see "F-Droid ships
  the developer's APK, and trails a release" above.
- **Google Play.** In progress, not live as of this writing.
- **iOS.** Build-from-source only: the wrapper in `ios/` compiles with Xcode
  and runs on your own device, re-signed every 7 days on a free Apple ID.
  No App Store, no TestFlight (both wait on a paid developer account). It is
  a wrapper around the bundled app, not the web page; see the iOS limit
  above and "The iOS app's deltas" below.

## Android app deltas

The Android app is the same `app/` code inside a native WebView wrapper.
Everything above still applies; this section states what changes on Android
and why none of it weakens the core claim (the relay never sees a position).

- **Asset origin, no service worker.** App assets are bundled into the APK
  and served locally through `WebViewAssetLoader` at
  `https://appassets.androidplatform.net/`, which WebView treats as a
  secure context, so WebCrypto and IndexedDB behave the same as on the web.
  `sw.js` is never registered in the wrapper: there is nothing to cache
  offline when the app itself already ships as the offline copy. This also
  removes the service-worker-pins-the-shell mitigation the web threat model
  leans on for a compromised-server scenario, but the wrapper does not need
  it, since its assets ship in the signed APK rather than being fetched
  from the server on every load.
- **Keystore-backed biometric wrap, not WebAuthn PRF.** A plain WebView has
  no `navigator.credentials`, so the wrapper cannot use the web app's
  WebAuthn PRF path. It substitutes a native bridge: an AES-GCM key held in
  the Android Keystore with `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`, unlocked
  through `BiometricPrompt` with a `CryptoObject`. This is hardware-gated
  the same way PRF is (the key material never leaves secure hardware), and
  Android invalidates the Keystore key automatically when the user's
  biometric enrollment changes, closing the same "new fingerprint added by
  an attacker" gap PRF closes on the web. The passcode path (Argon2id, the
  same WebAssembly module as everywhere else) is unchanged and remains the
  guaranteed unlock method.
- **Foreground service visibility.** Background location sharing runs as an
  Android foreground service, which Android requires to show a notification
  the entire time it runs. Android 14 and later let that notification be
  swiped away on an unlocked phone; Starling posts it again at once while
  the share runs. This is a design constraint the app leans into rather than
  works around: sharing is never silent, matching the same "always show a
  live sharing indicator" principle from the web app's design consequences
  above. The service requests fine and coarse location while-in-use only; it
  does not request `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`, and it only starts while
  the app has foreground state to begin with.
- **Keeping the page running with the screen off.** Chromium freezes a
  hidden page after a minute or five, which stopped every share whose phone
  was put down. During a share the wrapper makes the page visible to
  Chromium for a second whenever it freezes, and after a swipe with "keep
  sharing when the app is closed" on it holds the page in a window on a
  private virtual display the app owns. Nothing is drawn there: the window's
  root view is hidden, it never gets a surface, and no other app can see or
  capture a private display. The keys stay in the same page in the same
  process, exactly as they did before; the change is that the page keeps
  running. Two permissions come with it. `WAKE_LOCK` keeps the CPU up for the
  seconds a fix takes to seal and post, only during a share.
  `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` lets the app ask once, in a system
  dialog the person answers, to be left out of battery optimization. Neither
  reads or reaches any data.
- **The sharing report.** Settings can copy a plain-text report for bug
  reports: versions, the device model, permission and battery states, and
  counts and ages. It is built from a fixed list of fields, each checked
  against the shape it should have, so it cannot carry a position, a key, a
  name, a place, a circle or a relay address. The app never sends it; the
  person pastes it wherever they choose.
- **Panic trigger via PanicKit.** The app responds to
  `info.guardianproject.panic` `ACTION_TRIGGER` from a paired app (for
  example Ripple) by immediately wiping IndexedDB, localStorage, and
  WebView's storage and cache, with no confirmation step, then closing the
  activity. Pairing itself (`ACTION_CONNECT`) is a visible, user-initiated
  step, and the trigger handler checks the sender package against the
  paired app before acting, so an arbitrary app on the device cannot fire a
  wipe by sending the intent. This is the same effect as the in-app panic
  wipe button, reachable without unlocking the app first.
- **Tile fetches and relay visibility unchanged.** The Android app talks to
  the same relay over the same protocol, so everything in "What the relay
  does learn, honestly" above applies without modification: IP addresses,
  timing, and channel shape, never positions or identities. Map tile
  requests to `tile.openstreetmap.org` behave identically to the web app,
  including the Off-grid basemap's zero-request alternative.
- **Custom relay trust boundary.** The Android app exposes the same
  self-hosted relay setting as the web app. Pointing the app at a relay run
  by someone else, malicious or not, does not change what that relay can
  learn: ciphertext, IPs, and timing, the same set described above for the
  default relay. A malicious custom relay cannot read positions or
  identities any more than a malicious default-relay operator could,
  because the encryption boundary is the client, not the server a client
  happens to be configured to talk to. It could, however, refuse to expire
  data, drop or delay messages, or log metadata more aggressively than the
  default relay does; those are availability and metadata-retention risks,
  not confidentiality risks, and are the user's own choice when they pick a
  relay to trust.

## Your own server (Android)

Settings, Sharing, "Your own server" sends your own position to an address you
give, in OwnTracks' HTTP format, while a share runs. It is for people who
already run Reitti, Dawarich, Home Assistant or an OwnTracks forwarder, so one
app does the GPS work (#10).

- It is plaintext by design. The server you point it at is yours and reads your
  position, the way any OwnTracks server does. The relay's blindness does not
  extend to it. Only your own position goes there, never your circle's.
- It goes straight from the wrapper (`Forward.kt`), over https only, following
  no redirects, at most once every 15 seconds, and only while the location
  service runs, which is only during a share.
- It never leaves outside Tor. With Tor mode on it sends nothing.
- A second destination for a position is what someone with access to your
  phone would set, so it is never quiet. The sharing notification names the
  host (the private version; the lock screen version stays generic), so does
  the line under your name, and with the app lock on, setting, changing or
  clearing it needs the passcode. The duress passcode is refused there like
  any wrong one.
- The address, key included, sits in the wrapper's private preferences like
  its other settings, outside the vault. Settings and the data export show the
  host only, never the address, since servers put their key in its query. The
  panic wipe clears it with everything else.
- Your server gets your precise position whatever the precision setting.

## The iOS app's deltas

The iOS app is the same `app/` code inside a WKWebView wrapper (`ios/`),
served from the bundle on `starling://localhost`. Everything above still
applies: same protocol, same relay visibility, same encryption boundary.
What changes, honestly:

- **No background sharing, ever, in this build.** iOS offers nothing like
  the Android foreground service, and the wrapper deliberately ships no
  `StarlingNative` bridge, so `canShareInBackground()` reads false and the
  UI keeps saying sharing runs only while the app is open with the screen
  on. A wrapper that claimed more would be lying; this one does not.
- **No PanicKit, no OS-level wipe, no keystore vault, no Orbot awareness.**
  The in-app wipe (and the duress code that triggers it) clears everything
  the page can reach: IndexedDB, localStorage, and its own state. What it
  cannot reach from JS is WebKit's HTTP cache, where map tiles of viewed
  areas can persist until iOS evicts them; the in-app wipe confirmation
  already discloses this residual, and the Off-grid basemap never creates
  it. A native cache-clear bridge is roadmap; until it ships, the honest
  statement is "the wipe leaves cached tiles behind on iOS".
- **Backups.** The wrapper marks WebKit's data store excluded from iCloud
  and device backups at every launch, the same decision Android makes with
  `allowBackup="false"`: a circle secret that rode into a cloud backup
  would outlive the phone it was scoped to.
- **Tile fetches behave exactly as they do everywhere else.** Street
  basemaps and the beacon helper page load tiles from
  `tile.openstreetmap.org` on iOS the same way the web and Android builds
  do, viewport and all, and the helper page loads them immediately because
  an emergency page that waited on a map consent would be worse than the
  disclosure. The Off-grid basemap's zero-request alternative works here
  too. No iOS-specific mitigation exists or is pretended.
- **Invite links do not open the app.** No universal links yet (they need a
  paid team's association file), so a tapped invite opens Safari's landing
  page; joining means copying the link and pasting it inside the app. The
  landing copy says so on iOS rather than pointing at an APK.
- **Distribution is the weakest link.** Build-from-source, self-signed,
  7-day re-sign on a free Apple ID. No store review, no TestFlight, and no
  reproducible-build story yet on this platform; the APK's verification
  path does not exist here. Treat the iOS build as something you compile
  and vouch for yourself.

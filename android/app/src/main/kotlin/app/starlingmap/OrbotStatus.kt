// Asks Orbot which SOCKS port it is actually listening on.
//
// 9050 is Orbot's default and is right almost every time, so it stays the
// fallback and nothing here is required for Tor mode to work. But the port is
// configurable, and a wrong port fails closed: traffic stops rather than
// leaking, which is safe and also indistinguishable from the app being
// broken. Asking costs one broadcast.
//
// Orbot answers ACTION_START with a status broadcast carrying the live ports.
// NetCipher used to be the polite way to do this; it has been unmaintained
// since 2020 and never read the port extra it declared constants for, so this
// talks to Orbot directly. The receiver must be registered EXPORTED: Orbot is
// a separate app, and a not-exported receiver silently never fires.

// Letting somebody in, and being let in.
//
// This is the one exchange in Starling where two devices that have never met
// have to agree about who each other is, and it is where round after round of
// review has found defects: not in the sealing, in the ORDER. Who is checked
// before what is written down, what has already happened by the time a post
// fails, which step is the one that cannot be taken back.
//
// An ordering rule that lives in the order of a long function's awaits is not
// a rule anybody can read. It is an arrangement that happens to be right
// today, and the next person to add a step to the middle of it has no way to
// know what they broke. So the rules live here, stated, and main.js keeps the
// awaits: nothing in this file fetches, posts, stores, renders or toasts.
//
// It answers the questions instead. May this person be let in, and what has to
// be true first. What each step of admitting them commits, and what undoes it
// if the step after it fails. On the joining side: which of the messages on a
// rendezvous channel are worth keeping, when a welcome is finished, and when
// somebody answering the link is a stranger. Which invitation belongs to this
// circle, when it has run out, and when it is spent rather than merely unused.

// test can hold the app to it instead of hoping the awaits still read the same
// way after the next edit.
//
// Two properties are the whole point of the order, and both were bought with a
// real defect.
//
// The slot is claimed BEFORE the re-key. A rendezvous channel holds MEMBER_CAP
// member slots and anybody holding the link can fill them with identities of
// their own. This device has never posted there, since the joiner's request is
// what starts the conversation, so the welcome is its FIRST post and the cap
// turns exactly that one away. Run the other way round, the wraps were on the
// relay, the generation was open and the joiner was pinned into it before
// anyone found out, and the failure the cap produces is permanent for that
// channel. The cheap check goes first and the re-key that would have to be
// unwound never happens.
//
// The welcome is the commit point, and it goes LAST. The member records mean
// nothing without it, because openWelcomeRecord seals each one under the
// welcome's own context, so an orphan record opens for nobody and is counted
// by nobody. Posted welcome-first, a delivery that stopped partway left a
// welcome standing on the channel with records missing, and the joiner opened
// that same stale welcome on every later poll: it is the first one in the
// buffer, so a retry's complete welcome was never even looked at.

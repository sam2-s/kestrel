// Multiple circles, one active. The active circle keeps living in the
// original kv slots (secret, identity, profile, circleName, circleShare,
// lastSentTs), so a device that only ever holds one circle never changes
// shape. The inactive circles wait in a single array: plaintext under the
// `circles` key with the app lock off, or split with the lock on into
// `vaultCircles` (names, chain keys, profiles, rosters, timestamps, sharing
// settings, sealed under the vault key) plus
// `circleIdentities` (the keypairs, which are non-extractable CryptoKeys and
// can only be structured-cloned, never serialized into a sealed blob; they
// reveal the same class of thing the active identity already does today: key
// material counts, but no names, no keys, no channels).
//
// Every mutation here writes the inactive array BEFORE the active slots, so a
// crash between the two duplicates a circle instead of losing one; boot runs
// reconcileCircles to drop the duplicate.
//
// What v2 changed here: `secret` is no longer a circle root that lives
// forever. It is the OLDEST RETAINED CHAIN KEY of the circle's current
// generation, rewritten as the ratchet moves, and on its own it names nothing:
// the channel comes from the generation's anchor, which is derived from a seed
// that was destroyed the moment the generation opened. So the chain key now
// travels with a `genMeta` record naming the generation, and with the pinned
// roster the circle verifies its members against. Those two are new slots;
// the crown-jewel slot keeps its name, its 32 bytes, and every crash-window
// rule already proven around it.

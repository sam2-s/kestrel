// call sites and correct at three: the receiver member cap compared against a
// size that was never there and did nothing for a release, and the accept
// path pinned a member without ever asking whether the agreement key was a

// b64uDecode takes any string in its character class, and base64url has slack
// at the end: the last character of a 32 or 65 byte key carries two bits
// nothing decodes, so four different strings mean the same bytes. Keys were
// pinned as the text the relay served and then compared as text, so the same
// key re-encoded read as somebody else's, and what that raises is the card
// telling a person to check a safety number and think about removing a member
// who has changed nothing.

// --------------------------------------------------------- pinning a member

// May this record be pinned, and in what form?
//
// One answer for every path that adds somebody to the durable roster, because
// the three rules below have each been missing from one path or another:
//
//   - the agreement key has to be a real P-256 point. A 33 byte compressed key
//     satisfies every other check here and on the relay, and pinning one
//     leaves a member every other device refuses: they read the circle for as
//     long as it lasts, appear on nobody else's roster, cannot be removed by
//     anyone else, and leave everyone with a membership warning nothing clears.
//   - the algorithm is a function of the public key and never a wire field.
//     Taken off a record, an inviter could put "ed25519" on a welcome record
//     carrying a P-256 key: every joiner pinned the wrong algorithm, and the
//     moment that member posted anything it read as a key change against
//     somebody who had changed nothing. That alarm never clears, because the
//     real member keeps presenting the real key, and the safety number does
//     not cover `alg` so no amount of checking it in person resolves it.
//   - the member id commits to both keys, so re-deriving it is what makes the
//     safety number a person read out loud the number of the member who
//     actually lands in the roster.
//
// `pinned` is anything with a `get` and a `size`, which is the live roster map
// or the duck-typed store main.js hands net.js. `cap` is the occupancy bound:
// a caller pinning into a channel's own slots wants the default, and a caller
// that has never had one says so out loud rather than by omission.
//
// Returns a verdict, never a mutation. `already` means the id is in the roster
// and its existing record is the answer: a member is not re-pinned by meeting
// them again, because a re-pin would quietly drop whatever the person has
// since verified.

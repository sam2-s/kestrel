-- Starling relay storage. Ciphertext, pinned member keys, and the signature
-- each point was posted with; every row carries a server timestamp (srv) so
-- the TTL sweep can expire it.
--
-- The _v3 suffix is a migration, not decoration. deploy.sh runs this file on
-- every deploy, and SQLite has no "ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS", so a schema
-- change that alters existing tables cannot be expressed idempotently under
-- the old names. Fresh names plus a drop of the old ones is idempotent in
-- both directions: the second deploy creates nothing and drops nothing.
--
-- v3 is the protocol v2 wire format (see docs/PROTOCOL.md). Two things
-- changed: members now pin an agreement key (epk) alongside the signing key,
-- since a member id commits to both; and points now carry an epoch (e), since
-- content keys advance per epoch and a receiver needs it to pick the right
-- key. Nothing is lost that was not expiring anyway; every row here has a
-- 24 hour life and members re-post within seconds.
